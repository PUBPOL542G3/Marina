# Marina
This folder contains a tutorial on reshaping and cleaning data using the Python language Jupyter Notebook.

This folder contains the following files:
1) FAOSTAT_data_1-21-2021.xls
2) data_cleaning_marina.ipynb
3) marina_cleaned.xlsx

"FAOSTAT_data_1-21-2021.xls" is a raw data file that I use the Jupyter Notebook file "data_cleaning_marina.ipynb" to clean. The "marina_cleaned.xlsx" file is the final, cleaned and reformatted output.
